## Project Examples

While I have worked on several machine learning projects over the years, I am unable to share many of them due to confidentiality agreements and privacy concerns with my clients. However, I am happy to discuss these projects in more detail during a consultation call and can provide general information about the types of projects I have worked on in the past.

Here are a few examples of projects I have worked on that I can share:

- Object Detection and Classification: Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to detect and classify objects in images for a retail client. The model was able to accurately identify various objects, including clothing, accessories, and electronics.
- Sentiment Analysis: Developed a machine learning model using NLTK and scikit-learn to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews for a hospitality client. The model was able to accurately classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Language Translation: Developed a neural machine translation model using TensorFlow to translate English text to French for a language learning app. The model was able to accurately translate various types of text, including short phrases and full sentences.

- Speech Recognition: I built a speech recognition system that uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to transcribe spoken words into text.

- Music Genre Classification: I trained a deep neural network to classify music into different genres based on the audio waveform.

- Audio Fingerprinting: I developed an audio fingerprinting system that uses the acoustic characteristics of a song to identify it, even if it has been modified or distorted.

- Sound Synthesis: I created a program that synthesizes new sounds by combining and manipulating existing sounds.

If you have a specific project in mind or would like to learn more about my experience and expertise, please don't hesitate to contact me. I am always happy to discuss new opportunities and explore how we can work together to achieve your goals.

I am a freelance machine learning specialist, specializing in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). With over 2 years of experience in the industry, I have worked on several projects for various clients and have delivered high-quality solutions that meet their specific requirements.

## Skills and Expertise

### Computer Vision

I have extensive experience in computer vision and have worked on several projects related to object detection, image classification, and segmentation. Some of the tools and libraries I use in my work include:

- OpenCV - ![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-5C3EE8?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white)
- TensorFlow - ![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white)
- Keras - ![Keras](https://img.shields.io/badge/Keras-D00000?style=for-the-badge&logo=keras&logoColor=white)

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

In addition to computer vision, I also specialize in NLP and have worked on several projects related to sentiment analysis, text classification, and language translation. Some of the tools and libraries I use in my work include:

- NLTK - ![NLTK](https://img.shields.io/badge/NLTK-333333?style=for-the-badge&logo=nltk&logoColor=white)
- Gensim - ![Gensim](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gensim-47A248?style=for-the-badge&logo=gensim&logoColor=white) 


## Project Examples

While I have worked on several machine learning projects over the years, I am unable to share many of them due to confidentiality agreements and privacy concerns with my clients. However, I am happy to discuss these projects in more detail during a consultation call and can provide general information about the types of projects I have worked on in the past.

Here are a few examples of projects I have worked on that I can share:

- Object Detection and Classification: Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to detect and classify objects in images for a retail client. The model was able to accurately identify various objects, including clothing, accessories, and electronics.
- Sentiment Analysis: Developed a machine learning model using NLTK and scikit-learn to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews for a hospitality client. The model was able to accurately classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Language Translation: Developed a neural machine translation model using TensorFlow to translate English text to French for a language learning app. The model was able to accurately translate various types of text, including short phrases and full sentences.

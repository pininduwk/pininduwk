  # Pinindu Wekunagoda 

I'm Pinindu from Sri Lanka, and I study Artificial intelligence and Data Science at the University of Robert Gordon Aberdeen. And BCS certificate level. I enjoy learning, build projects, and coding like Python, C, C++. I also enjoy doing Robotic projects and Machine learning.

## Skills and Experience
🐍 Python
🌟Git/C/C++
💻Java/Arduino

## Exaple of Work
### Artificial intellience 
 
 pyqlearning is Python library to implement Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning, especially for Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network, and Multi-agent Deep Q-Network which can be optimized by Annealing models such as Simulated Annealing, Adaptive Simulated Annealing, and Quantum Monte Carlo Method.

This library makes it possible to design the information search algorithm such as the Game AI, web crawlers, or Robotics. But this library provides components for designers, not for end-users of state-of-the-art black boxes.

### Quantum computing 
Using quirk open source doing,

⁕Drag-and-drop circuit editing.
⁕Reacts, simulates, and animates in real time.
⁕Inline state displays.
⁕Bookmarkable circuits.
⁕Up to 16 qubits.
